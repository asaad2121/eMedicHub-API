## ⚠️ Resetting DynamoDB (Local Testing Only)

We have a script to reset (delete and recreate) all DynamoDB tables and seed initial data for local development and testing purposes.

**Important:**  
This script **must only be run in your local development environment**. Running it on production or shared environments can result in data loss!

### How it works:

- The reset script checks environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` to ensure it only runs when:
    - `ENVIRONMENT=dev`

- If these conditions are not met, the script will refuse to run.

### How to run:

```bash
npm run reset-db
